      <h3>Early Life and Theatre Beginnings</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Helen Kenworthy</strong> was born in{" "}
        <strong>Solihull, England</strong>, into a home where creativity
        mattered. She and her mother, <strong>Valerie Lewis</strong>, shared a
        love of <strong>theatre</strong> and could regularly be seen watching
        shows from ‘the gods’. A love of reading, writing and making up
        fantastical tales later blossomed into their beloved children’s series,{" "}
        <strong>Snuffer and Robertson</strong>. But it was Helen’s early passion
        for performing that first lit the fuse of what would become a{" "}
        <strong>lifelong journey into theatre</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a new graduate, Helen was mentored by one of Britain’s most
        influential theatrical producers, <strong>Bill Kenwright CBE</strong>,
        who recognised her natural flair, humour, and relentless commitment to
        making theatre matter. Helen had trained in{" "}
        <strong>English, Theatre, and Education</strong>, laying the foundation
        for what would become an{" "}
        <strong>extraordinary career spanning three decades</strong> across
        stage, page, and classroom.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Bill Kenwright</strong> became{" "}
        <strong>RYTC’s Patron 20 years before his death in 2024</strong>. He
        remains <strong>Patron in perpetuity</strong>, a gesture that honours
        their enduring creative connection and shared belief in the{" "}
        <strong>power of performance to change lives</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>Professional Theatre and Educational Leadership</h3>
      <p>
        Helen’s early career was spent{" "}
        <strong>directing and producing theatre</strong> across regional venues,
        youth arts programmes, and within <strong>Theatre-in-Education</strong>.
        Her knack for turning chaotic rehearsal rooms into launchpads for{" "}
        <strong>confidence and creativity</strong> earned her{" "}
        <strong>national attention</strong>. She led{" "}
        <strong>English departments</strong> in both mainstream and alternative
        education, taught in prisons, and developed{" "}
        <strong>award-winning arts-led mental health initiatives</strong> for
        vulnerable learners.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her approach has always been rooted in the same principle:{" "}
        <strong>Art is for everyone—and it can save lives</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <strong>1994</strong>, Helen founded{" "}
        <strong>
          The RYTC (The Really Youthful Theatre Company which became RYTC
          Creatives CIC in 2022)
        </strong>
        ; a <strong>dynamic community organisation</strong> that brings together{" "}
        <strong>
          youth development, community outreach, mental health awareness, and
          creative empowerment
        </strong>
        . The CIC quickly grew into a <strong>trusted delivery partner</strong>{" "}
        for schools, local authorities, and health boards across the UK.
      </p>
      <p>
        No creative project was too small—or too ambitious—for Helen’s team.
      </p>

      <h3>Give Get Go: Bringing Training to Life</h3>
      <p>
        Helen is a <strong>founding partner of Give Get Go Education</strong>,

        professionals, educators, and creatives alike.
      </p>

        <strong>creative strategies for de-escalating behaviour</strong>,” Give
        Get Go Education’s <strong>digital masterclasses</strong> are infused
        with humour, realism, and decades of practical insight. Her philosophy
        is simple:
      </p>
      <p>
        “
        <strong>
          Let’s stop waiting for the perfect stage, the ideal moment or the
          budget we’ll never get. Let’s start creating with what we have, where
          we are, right now.
        </strong>
        ”

        book series following a curious therapy dog (loosely based on the real
        RYTC companion dog, <strong>Seren</strong>) and his rabbit sidekick. The
